# clickBodyToggles.js
Click an anchor link and toggle a class on your body element.

Just include the JS and pass your anchor through. You should add the script in clickBodyToggles.js or the minified version to your build instead of making a seperate request.

The script is VERY lightweight and extendable. Feel free to extend and customize as needed.

```
<script src="clickBodyToggles-min.js"></script>
<script>
    addBodyToggle('menu');
</script>
```
